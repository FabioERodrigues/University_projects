** 1. Android login App(Java) 85/100  **

 • Project Overview: Developed a mobile app for university students that helps them stay organized and informed by providing features like secure login, personalized timetables, to-do lists, campus maps, and a personal profile section.
 
 • Key Functionalities: Implemented Firebase for secure user authentication, created dynamic timetables and to-do lists using RecyclerViews and Fragments, and integrated Google Maps for easy campus navigation.

 • Learnings: Gained expertise in Android app development, particularly in secure user authentication with Firebase, designing user-friendly interfaces, and integrating external APIs like Google Maps.


**2. Java Robot Simualation Coursework  82/100**

• Project Overview: 
A Java-based robot arena simulation, featuring various types of robots (e.g., PacMan, WhiskerRobot, BeamRobot) and interactive items like obstacles and a controllable PacMan robot.

•Key Functionalities:
OOP Design: Implemented class hierarchy with inheritance, abstract methods, and encapsulation for robots and arena items.
User Interaction: Control over simulation through mouse events, ability to move and delete items, and features like slow motion and saving progress.
              
•Learnings: 
Gained experience in Java concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes, and GUI development.
Identified improvement areas, including better planning, more concise code, and additional features like keyboard-controlled PacMan and improved beam robot behavior​

**3. Python Data science 82/100**
 
•Project Overview:
The project analyzes FTSE 100 Index trends from 2009 to 2023, focusing on key stock data like opening and closing prices, as well as high and low prices.

•Key Functionalities:
Data Visualization: Includes features like scatter plots, heatmaps, and stock price plotting using Python scripts and libraries.
Statistical Analysis: Implements train-test splits and evaluation models to understand stock market behavior over time.

•Learnings:
Gained hands-on experience in data science, stock market analysis, and visualization techniques using Python, along with an understanding of market trends and fluctuations over the years. The project uses machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on regression models for predicting stock prices based on the FTSE 100 Index data.
